                I'm Sarah Hussain, a Management Engineering student at the University of Waterloo with a passion for building thoughtful and tech-powered solutions. Whether it's a full-stack app or a data dashboard I love turning ideas into tools that solve real problems. 
                My background blends engineering, design, and business, which gives me a systems-level mindset and a bias toward execution. I’ve worked on everything from front-end experiences in React to backend workflows in Python and SQL.
                I’m currently looking for opportunities to collaborate on high-impact projects where I can grow as a developer and contribute to teams that care about both people and product.
